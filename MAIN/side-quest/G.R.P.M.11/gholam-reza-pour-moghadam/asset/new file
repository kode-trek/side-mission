Greetings Mr. Reza,

The other night you asked me a question, that I couldn't answer thoroughly at
the time.

You told me that you already discovered some patterns and established some
rules. Also You was curious, whether it is possible to FEED the machine those
RULES, we already discovered by analyzing the patterns.

The answer is, YES. However we need to be careful of a phenomenon called,
over-fitting.

According to Wikipedia:
	In statistics, overfitting is "the production of an analysis that
	corresponds TOO CLOSELY or EXACTLY to a particular set of data, and may
	therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations
	reliably"[1].
we need to be cautious not to feed them rules to machine, or we end up
predicting a few observations correctly, but missing the rest of them by
mistake.

After all, this is called TRAINing the machine. As it means let the machine, but
not the human, do the inducting procedure.

In case of feeding it the pre-defined RULES that we humans found out, that would
be INSTRUCTing the machine, rather than TRAINing.

There are several algorithms that let the machine figures them RULES all by
itself, including:
	- Apriori
	- FP-growth

Nevertheless I's glad to hear about the methods that you gained them
rules. Please explain them to me via AnyDesk.
